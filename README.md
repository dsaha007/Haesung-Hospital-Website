"Haesung Hospital Website: An interactive platform showcasing hospital services, doctor appointments, news, and an online medicine shop. Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript."

This repository contains the code for the Haesung Hospital website. The website provides information about the hospital, its services, contact details, a shop for medicines, recent news, and more.

## Why I Made This

This project is based on the fictional hospital, Haesung Hospital, depicted in the popular K-drama "Descendants of the Sun." The characters, events, and services showcased on this website are from the drama.

## [Visit Descendants of the Sun(2016) IMDb Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4925000/)

I created this website as a homage to the drama and its characters, out of fondness for the narrative and the portrayal of Haesung Hospital. It's a small endeavor to bring the fictional hospital to life in a tangible way, as a tribute to the series and its impact on viewers.
